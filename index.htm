		<p>  And one of those stupid mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't be special. Be one of us.' News flash! I am special, and I'll never be one of you! ... There it is. But it's just not ... I'm not fair game. I'm not a soft target. It's over. How complicated can it be? What they're not ready for, is guys like you and I, Nails, and all the other gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ... that we are high priests ... Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See where that goes. But I dare anyone to debate me on things. And I'm ... you know ... most of the time. And this includes naps! You know, I'm an F-18, bro. And I will destroy you in the air. And I will deploy my ordinance to the ground. And, uh ....</p>
		<p>Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing shy of that. And it is his job to go out there and embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not just beat them, but embarrass them in the process. But there are parts of me that is hopper, because my motto now is 'You either love, or you hate ... and you must do so violently.' And the reason you must hate violently is because ... and you have to hate everyone that is not in your family, because they're there to destroy your family, and they will come at you in all forms and shapes.   How complicated can it be? What they're not ready for, is guys like you and I, Nails, and all the other gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ... that we are high priests ... Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See where that goes. Let me just say this: It's nothing this side of deplorable, that a certain Chaim Levine - yeah, that's Chuck's real name - mistook this rock star for his own selfish exit strategy, bro.</p>
		<p>I'm done. I'm done. It's on. Bring it, as I say. I ain't hidin'. The goddesses? Alex, the goddesses .... Let me just say this about the goddesses: I don't believe the term is good enough ... is good enough ... but when you're bound by these terrestrial descriptions, you must use the best choice available, right? And the gratitude I get is this charlatan chose not to do his job, which is to WRITE. Clearly, someone who believes he is above the law. Well, you've been warned, dude. Bring it. How complicated can it be? What they're not ready for, is guys like you and I, Nails, and all the other gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ... that we are high priests ... Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See where that goes. Check it, Alex, I embarrassed him in front of his children and the world by healing at a pace that his unevolved mind can't process. Okay ... last I checked, Chaim, I've spent close to the last decade, I don't know, effortless and magically converting your tin cans into pure gold. They will lose the rest of their lives as they think about me and my life for the rest of their lives. So ... it's ... there's no ... again, bring me a challenge, somebody. Bring me a frickin' challenge. Because, you know ... it just ain't there. WINNING! How complicated can it be? What they're not ready for, is guys like you and I, Nails, and all the other gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ... that we are high priests ... Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See where that goes.</p>
		<p> I am every character in between, save for that little weirdo with his guts strapped in, begging for water. That's not me. I'm done. I'm done. It's on. Bring it, as I say. I ain't hidin'. He's as radical as you'd think he'd might be. If ... I'm not just my dad, I'm ... you know ... petting up the river to kill another part of me, which is 'courage'. And we are and, I don't know, winning?... Anyone? .... (long silence) .... Rhymes with winning? .... Anyone? .... Yeah, that would be us. Yes! I don't read anything after it's come out, because I will not waste my precious time on such ridiculous nonsense. But I understand, according to you, that there was a lot of curiosity about the Vatican assassins. And people say, 'Oh, you know... you have to work through your resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to them and they're gonna fuel my attack.</p>
		<p>Because you have absolute and total resolve about your decisions. If you love with violence and you hate with violence, there's nothing that can be questioned. And you know, to sully and to contaminate or radically disrespect this union with a shameful contract is something I'll leave to the amateurs and the bible grippers. Because you have absolute and total resolve about your decisions. If you love with violence and you hate with violence, there's nothing that can be questioned. So ... you know ... within that is tremendous focus, and tremendous clarity, and tremendous peace. No, you won't get high .... It's all good. It's all good, guys. Quit panicking. Quit panicking. No panic, no judgment. They will lose the rest of their lives as they think about me and my life for the rest of their lives. So ... it's ... there's no ... again, bring me a challenge, somebody. Bring me a frickin' challenge. Because, you know ... it just ain't there. WINNING! 100%. You know, here's your first pee test. Next one goes in your mouth.</p>
